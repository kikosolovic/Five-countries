    "response": "Welcome to India, sir. It's good that you've finally arrived. As you know, about 40% of Indians don't have access to clean water and as a result around 37.7 million Indians get sick from waterborne diseases. Furthermore, field crops suffer from poor yields. In an effort to alleviate these problems, you have two objectives. One is located to the north of us and the other - to the south. Let me tell you about them.",
    "options": "1. Ask about the mission to the north. 2. Ask about the mission to the south",

        "text": "What's to the north?",
        "response": "The village of Kaithi. The locals there are struggling because of the non-functional sewage treatment plant. You see, when the waste water does not get processed and filtered, it gets sent to the Ganges river polluted. Therefore the industrial and human waste that gets leaked into the river leads to the population getting sick or dying due to the lack of clean water and sanitation.",

            "text": "Have the locals found an alternative way to acquire clean water?",
            "response": "Not at all. Their only choices are to drink contaminated water or die of thirst. There is another option - drinking from underground springs. However, it is not applicable in this village.",

            "opt1": {
                "text": "Why's that?",
                "response": "Because there is no groundwater in the area. Nowadays the clean water that the Indians have access to usually comes from underground and the ones who don't have such sources are left with the filth from the rivers.",

We believe that one is located just below the crop field that is to the south. When you find it, you have to install a drip irrigation system which allows for minimal usage of water while effectively soaking the crops.
